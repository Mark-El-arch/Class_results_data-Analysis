Null values:
Q1_10 - 111; 111 students missed quiz 1
Q2_10 - 83;  83 students missed quiz 2
Q3_10 - 50   50 students missed quiz 3
Q4_10 - 48   48 students missed quiz 4
MS_30 - 8    8 students missed the mid-semester exams

REPORT:
I identified the outliers in the quizzes and mid semester score using the interquartile range
method.A few number of students, in some quizzes, none, displayed unusually low scores
indicating little performance extremes within the class

After a night of thinking through my achievement, completing phase 1 of my real data analysis,
I decided to drop the columns for the names and student IDs of my class, since I'll be making
this analysis public on github.



Phase 2:
Analysing the mean and standard deviation values of the various assessments.

REPORT:
Looking through the mean values, I noticed the performances were above average indicating
that the quizzes were of fair difficulty and so, apart from a few exceptions seen from the
outliers, my class generally performed well in the quizzes.
But for the mid semester exams, I noticed the mean is below average, indicating that our
performance in the exam declined, in relation to the quizzes, supporting this with the fact
that there were no outliers in the mid semester exams(no extreme highs or low).

Looking through the standard deviation values also, I could see some form inconsistency in
our performances in quizzes 1,2 and 4 and the mid semester exams, as compared to the quiz 3
with a lower standard deviation, indicating a little more stable performance than the other
quizzes mentioned above.

Conclusions:
1. Poor mid semester performance may be due to fatigue down the semester.
2. It may also be due to complacency, probably concluding from the quizzes the lightness of
   the mid semester exam.
