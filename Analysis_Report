PHASE 1: Basic Inspection Interpretation: Understanding the Dataset
Total entries = 669; 669 students

Minimum scores:          Maximum scores:      Mean scores:
Q1_10 - 0                Q1_10 - 10           Q1_10 - 6.08
Q2_10 - 0                Q2_10 - 10           Q2_10 - 5.33
Q3_10 - 0                Q3_10 - 10           Q3_10 - 6.32
Q4_10 - 0                Q4_10 - 10           Q4_10 - 6.98
MS_30 - 2.00             MS_30 - 29.00        MS_30 - 13.54
T_70  - 0                T_70  - 61           T_70  - 35.36
CA_30 - 0                CA_30 - 26           CA_30 - 15.16


Null values:
Q1_10 - 111; 111 students missed quiz 1
Q2_10 - 83;  83 students missed quiz 2
Q3_10 - 50   50 students missed quiz 3
Q4_10 - 48   48 students missed quiz 4
MS_30 - 8    8 students missed the mid-semester exams

REPORT:
I identified the outliers in the quizzes and mid semester score using the interquartile range
method.A few number of students, in some quizzes, none, displayed unusually low scores
indicating little performance extremes within the class

After a night of thinking through my achievement, completing phase 1 of my real data analysis,
I decided to drop the columns for the names and student IDs of my class, since I'll be making
this analysis public on github.



PHASE 2:
Analysing the mean and standard deviation values of the various assessments.

REPORT:
Looking through the mean values, I noticed the performances were above average indicating
that the quizzes were of fair difficulty and so, apart from a few exceptions seen from the
outliers, my class generally performed well in the quizzes.
But for the mid semester exams, I noticed the mean is below average, indicating that our
performance in the exam declined, in relation to the quizzes, supporting this with the fact
that there were no outliers in the mid semester exams(no extreme highs or low).

Looking through the standard deviation values also, I could see some form inconsistency in
our performances in quizzes 1,2 and 4 and the mid semester exams, as compared to the quiz 3
with a lower standard deviation, indicating a little more stable performance than the other
quizzes mentioned above.

Conclusions:
1. Poor mid semester performance may be due to fatigue down the semester.
2. It may also be due to complacency, probably concluding from the quizzes the lightness of
   the mid semester exam.


PHASE 3:
Analysing the relationships between the quizzes, mid semester exams and the total.
Trying to understand how the various quizzes and mid semester affected our total scores.

Correlations(2 d.p) on Total(T_70):
Q1_10 - 0.49
Q2_10 - 0.43
Q3_10 - 0.39
Q4_10 - 0.38
MS_30 - 0.74

REPORT:
Studying the various correlations of the quizzes and mid semester on our total scores,
it is of no doubt that the mid semester exams had a great impact on our total scores, indicating
that our total scores greatly depended on the mid semester exams.
The quizzes also fairly influenced on our total scores, quizzes 1 and 2 having more impact
than 3 and 4.
The mid semester exams had greatest impact on the total, followed by quiz 1, and then 2, down
to 3 and 4.
This is very logical, because, each quiz was out of 10, whereas the mid semester exams was out
of 30.

Conclusions:
From above, I can draw a conclusion that students who performed generally well in quizzes 1 and
2, and also in the mid semester exams had better total scores than the others.


PHASE4:
Finding the relationship between the quizzes, taking their total average, and our total
scores.

Correlation between total quizzes average, mid semester  and total scores:
Quizzes average - 0.64
MS - 0.74

REPORT:
Drawing insight from the correlation above, I can conclude that the quizzes collectively
had great influence on our total scores, nonetheless, the mid semester had a greater impact on
our total scores than the quizzes.
I went ahead to take a sample of 5 students in my dataframe to support the above insight.

Conclusion:
This essentially means that students with higher mid semester scores tend to have higher total
scores;
Sample students:
Index    MS_30    Quiz_avg    T_70
50       8.0      3.75        23
36       21.0     6.50        47
278      19.0     5.00        34
416      20       7.50        50
87       14       2.25        23
Looking the above data sample, it is clear that the students with high mid semester scores
coupled with a high quiz average tend to have high total scores


PHASE 5:
Grouping students into performance levels, low, average and high, to understand what these
categorized students did differently that set the difference.

REPORT:
Studying the data from my jupyter notebook carefully, I noticed that the performance consistency
in the quizzes had an impact on the totals, and also good performance in the mid semester results.
I see that the "low students" in this course, had around scores within 4-6 in their quizzes,
"average students" had within 6-7 in their quizzes and "high students" had within 7-8
The second result from my notebook explains it more, with the total quizzes average, it is very
clear, the consistency in the quiz performance of students, coupled with mid semester scores
sets the difference.

Conclusion:
I can then conclude, that in order to achieve higher total scores, taking this same scenario of
assessment structure, I will need to perform consistently high in the quizzes and also very good
in the mid semester exams.
